Dear Sir or Madam;

      The latest version of Sentry is being sent with this message.

      For a quick overview of the install process, please read the
      enclosed QSTART.TXT file, and for more detail, see the README.TXT
      file (the latter can be viewed by typing "README" at the DOS
      prompt).

      Should you encounter any difficulties, I can be reached at

Sincerely,


Michael A. Bobbitt
