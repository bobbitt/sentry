        Revision History
        ================

        Pre-Release Notes
        -----------------
        March 95   - My search for DOS security programs is
                     unsuccessful. The general idea for Sentry is
                     formed.

        April 95   - Coding for Sentry begins.

        May 95     - Still coding...

        June 95    - Sentry is now a complete program.

        July 95    - Beta testing. Many updates made.


        Sentry V1.0
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 July 95

        - Sentry V1.0 is released. Contains basic functionality. At this
          point, Sentry is approximately 1700 lines of code.


        Sentry V1.1
        -----------
        Release Date: 27 July 95

        - Sentry V1.1 Released. V1.1 fixes some bugs in V1.0, and has
          these additions:

          * Date format is selectable.

          * Users with no password expiration are not assigned an expiry
            date on entering a new password.

          * Incorrect password verification displayed immediately when
            creating a new user, or toggling SuperUser status.


        Sentry V1.2
        -----------
        Release Date: 29 July 95

        - Sentry V1.2 Released. Some more minor bugs are repaired and
          several areas are updated. Additions are:

          * Memory management improved.

          * All user stats now shown instead of just login name.

          * The keyboard buffer is flushed after an invalid login
            attempt.


        Sentry V1.3
        -----------
        Release Date: 01 Aug 95

        - Sentry V1.3 Released. Again, more bugs were fixed in this
          version. Additions are:

          * The log file is now much more detailed than before, and
            includes a time stamp on every action.

          * A bug with deleting a user listed as 15th or later in the
            password file has been fixed. (Regardless of what page the
            user you selected to delete was on, a user from the first
            page was always deleted).

          * A bug in the multi-user display was fixed. (If the last page
            contained one user, you could not page down to see him).


        Sentry V1.4
        -----------
        Release Date: 08 Aug 95

        - Sentry V1.4 Released. Some minor changes have been made,
          mostly for the sake of appearance. Additions are:

          * The Sentry.ini file now allows the user to select the
            colours to be used for normal and highlighted text.

          * Input routines have been improved and simplified.
            Inappropriate characters have been stripped from the input
            stream.


        Sentry V2.0
        -----------
        Release Date: 11 Aug 95

        - Sentry V2.0 Released. Many revisions, fixes and additions have
          been made to the program for this release. Most of the update
          ideas came from Bret Jacobsen. Additions include:

          * Invalid login/password length messages (both to the screen
            and log file) are user-definable in the Sentry.ini file.

          * If a normal user attempts to log in as a SuperUser, it is
            recorded in the log file.

          * The SuperUser Login flag is cleared after an invalid login.
            (This is a bug fix: previously if CTRL-ENTER was pressed
            during an invalid login attempt, the next successful login
            attempt would be as a SuperUser, as long as the user had
            access).

          * A bug with the Toggle SuperUser Access option corrupting the
            time stamps has been fixed.

          * The log file is again re-organized to be more "readable."

          * You can no longer delete the last SuperUser on your system
            (thereby locking yourself out). Sentry performs a check
            previous to deletion and will abort if you are deleting the
            last SuperUser.

          * A bug with the input skipping characters was fixed.

          * After a successful login, the number of invalid login
            attempts since your last successful login is now shown.

          * The user can now abort a password change, unless the
            password has expired.

          * The option to reset an account's password has been added to
            the SuperUser menu.

          * You can now define the number of invalid logins permissible
            before an account expires (locks up). The default setting is
            defined in the Sentry.ini file, and the settings for
            individual accounts can be modified from the SuperUser menu.


        Sentry V2.1
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Aug 95

          * Input no longer automatically ends after "MaxPasswordLen"
            characters have been entered at the login or password
            prompts. Input continues as required, however only
            "MaxPasswordLen" characters are used. Any extra characters
            are discarded.

          * Case sensitivity for logins can now be turned on and off via
            the Sentry.ini file. This is applicable to logins only,
            passwords are still case sensitive.


        Sentry V2.2
        -----------
        Release Date: 10 Sep 95

          * Sentry now uses windowed screens for all output, as opposed
            to simply directing output to the entire screen.

          * When entering dates, the year is now checked. If it is not 4
            characters, the user is forced to re-enter it. This was
            causing problems with Sentry accepting '96' as a valid year,
            and subsequently not translating correctly.

          * A bug with the password encoding scheme has been fixed. The
            encryption used to truncate passwords at length 8, causing
            only the first 8 characters to be recognized. For
            SuperUsers, this meant that passwords over 8 would not
            contain the SuperUser stamp (it was truncated). This problem
            has now been rectified, and passwords are significant for
            MaxPasswordLen characters. All in all, this seriously
            increases the amount of security available from Sentry.

            NOTE: Because of the above modification, older versions of
            Sentry cannot use password files from V2.2 and up. The
            reverse is not true however, as Sentry V2.2 can use password
            files all the way back to V1.0.

            Also note that to use passwords over 8 characters, you must
            re-create the old passwords. This can be easily done by
            selecting the "Change Account Password" option from the
            SuperUser menu.


        Sentry V2.3
        -----------
        Release Date: 24 Sep 95

          * Small bugs with windowed mode have been fixed.

          * Windowed mode is now optional. For those that prefer
            "normal" operation, you can set that in the Sentry.ini file.

          * Log file viewing can now handle long lines, and you can skip
            to the end of the file by pressing the ESC key once.

          * Quickstart instructions are now included in the Qstart.txt
            file.


        Sentry V2.4
        -----------
        Release Date: 06 Oct 95

          * The Sentry.ini file can now be edited from the SuperUser
            menu. The user can get information on each attribute,
            including a brief description, security notes, default
            setting, and the current setting just by selecting which
            attribute they wish to change.


        Sentry V2.5
        -----------
        Release Date: 10 Oct 95

          * Sentry can now be run from any location. The user does not
            have to be in the Sentry home directory for it to work
            properly.


        Sentry V2.6
        -----------
        Release Date: 25 Oct 95

          * The SuperUser may modify the "Login:" and "Password:"
            prompts to suit their custom environment. These are changed
            either through the Sentry.ini file or via the SuperUser
            menu.

          * Any setting changes made via the SuperUser menu are now
            recorded in the log file. This will help SuperUser keep a
            history of setting changes, which is useful in the case of a
            security audit.

          * An environment variable is now set by Sentry upon successful
            login. The variable is set to the username of the person
            logging in. This can be very useful if you wish other
            programs to link with Sentry and perform specific actions
            depending on who is logging in. (For example: if it is a
            SuperUser logging in, you may wish to display some system
            stats, or you may want to display individual greetings (or
            warnings) based on who is logging in).


        Sentry V2.7
        -----------
        Release Date: 28 Oct 95

          * Sentry now uses a screen saver to blank the screen during
            idle periods. Although this feature does not add to Sentry's
            security, it now means that users can run Sentry before
            leaving their terminal and not worry about burn-in.


        Sentry V3.0
        -----------
        Release Date: 10 Nov 95

          * The old password and Sentry.ini files are no more!
            These files have been done away with, since they posed a
            slight security risk. This removes the need to edit the
            initialization settings by hand.

          * You can no longer revoke SuperUser access from the last
            SuperUser on your system. By doing this, you could
            potentially lock yourself out of your system, so it is not a
            valid option any more.

          * "Exploding Windows" are now available. These can be turned
            on via the initialization settings. This is for appearance
            only, and has no effect on functionality.

          * The user can now select a message to appear randomly on the
            screen during the screen saver. This fixes a bug in previous
            versions where the cursor remained in the upper left corner
            during the screen saver, which could case burn-in.

          * Upon exiting the SuperUser menu, the screen is restored to
            the way it was before Sentry was run. This eliminates the
            problem of sensitive information remaining on your screen.


        Sentry V3.1
        -----------
        Release Date: 03 Dec 95

          * The user can now select the character to be echoed to the
            screen when a password is entered. In addition, the user can
            chose to have no character or the actual character echoed.

          * The log file now records when the Sentry DOS shell is
            entered and exited.


        Sentry V3.2
        -----------
        Release Date: 08 Dec 95

          * The maxixum number of invalid logins can now be set during
            user creation.

          * The initialization settings contain a parameter for
            automatically expiring accounts that have been inactive for
            a given amount of time.

          * SuperUsers can now send a one-line memo to any user
            (including themself). This is useful for reminders,
            warnings, or explainations (why is user X locked out?).


        Sentry V3.3
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Dec 95

          * SuperUsers now have the ability to protect a file. That is,
            when they run this option on a given executable file, that
            file becomes "protected." The next time that file is run,
            Sentry will execute. If a correct login and password are
            given, then the original file is executed, otherwise the
            user is locked out.

          * The initialization settings can now be exported and
            re-loaded during an upgrade. (IE: you don't have to rebuild
            your entire account structure and preferences each time you
            upgrade.)

          * Faster disk I/O.

          * Many sections of code have been optimized.

          * Message files can now reside on a drive other than the drive
            that Sentry.exe is on. This is a bug fix from 3.2.

          * Windows now have titles.


        Sentry V3.4
        -----------
        Release Date: 01 Jan 96

          * Install program now handles many of the "low-level"
            procedures, including file copying and editing. This removes
            the much of the burden from the user during the install.


        Sentry V3.5
        -----------
        Release Date: 05 Jan 96

          * The log file has been slightly re-designed. Now each user
            has their own "log file" which can be viewed and/or purged.
            This makes it easier to track an individual's activities -
            all you have to do is view their log file to see everything
            they have done, without the extra clutter.

          * File protection has been slightly re-worked to be compatible
            with more files.


        Sentry V3.6
        -----------
        Release Date: 11 Jan 96

          * When viewing the userlist, the current action is shown at
            the prompt (IE: Delete, Change Password, etc).

          * The SuperUser menu has been broken down. System
            administation is still done from the main menu, but user
            maintenance now has it's own submenu.

          * Hot keys are back after popular demand. (IE: one key press
            executes a menu option).

          * Screen is reset between major menus. This reduces
            unnecessary clutter on the screen.


        Sentry V3.7
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Jan 96

          * A backup log file has been added. Information is moved from
            the primary log file to the backup log file automatically,
            once the log file reaches a user specified size.

          * The screen saver can now be activated automatically by
            pressing the F2 key at any time.

          * When protecting .BAT files, the corresponding .EXE file will
            not be over-written (if it exists).


        Sentry V3.8
        -----------
        Release Date: 31 Jan 96

          * The descriptions of the initialization settings have been
            removed from the Sentry.exe file. This saves about 10kb of
            memory when using protected files, plus speeds up general
            operation by about 1/6.

          * An uninstall option has been added to the install program.


        Sentry V4.0
        -----------
        Release Date: 10 Feb 96

          * File protection is now more stable. In previous versions of
            Sentry, a protected file could become corrupt if the account
            structure was modified in certain ways.

          * Exiting the screen saver now requires your password when on
            the SuperUser menu, or any submenu. This allows you to
            activate the screen saver (F2) and leave your terminal
            without having to exit the SuperUser menu.


        Sentry V4.1
        -----------
        Release Date: 15 Feb 96

          * Files can no longer be protected twice. Protecting a file
            multiple times caused some problems, while providing little
            or no added functionality.

          * Online help is now available by pressing the F1 key at any
            time. Help is context sensitive and will automatically bring
            up the topic related to your current actions.


        Sentry V4.2
        -----------
        Release Date: 22 Feb 96

          * Sentry now uses a secure file deletion process. This means
            that any attempt to recover files deleted by Sentry will
            reveal only useless "garbage."

          * During login, the password is padded on screen after it is
            entered. This means that a 6 character password will be
            padded out to the maximum length with the echo character.
            This is done so that a password's length cannot be
            determined if someone glances at your screen.


        Sentry V4.3
        -----------
        Release Date: 25 Feb 96

          * A few minor bugs with the display were fixed (if the title
            was disabled, the title box would still appear, etc).

          * The option to turn "type-ahead" on or off has been added to
            the initialization settings.

          * The option to clear the screen before executing has been
            added to the initialization settings.


        Sentry V4.4
        -----------
        Release Date: 07 Mar 96

          * Install program now allows use of hidden directories.

          * The SuperUser can now enter a DOS shell from the SuperUser
            menu to perform quick DOS operations.


        Sentry V4.5
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Mar 96

          * A "Please Wait" message now appears during disk access to
            let the user know that Sentry is working. This is helpful
            for some operations (like protecting a large file) that take
            a considerable amount of time.

          * A Security Audit feature has been added to the SuperUser
            menu. The Security Audit checks for potential weaknesses in
            three areas: System, Initialization Settings, and Account
            Structure. Weaknesses can be fixed on the spot if desired.

          * A bug with protected file's initialization settings showing
            up incorrectly has been fixed.


        Sentry V4.6
        -----------
        Release Date: 05 Apr 96

          * The Security Audit and install program now add the BootKeys
            line to the MSDOS.SYS file intelligently.

          * Some minor bugs have been fixed in various places.

          * The user must accept the license agreement prior to
            installation.


        Sentry V4.7
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Apr 96

          * More minor modifications. Many cosmetic changes have been
            made. Problems with the log file in individual mode,
            problems with skipping the SuperUser menu when changing
            passwords, and several other small bugs have all been fixed
            in this version.

          * Some basic operations have been "sped up" allowing almost
            all operations to run faster.


        Sentry V5.0
        -----------
        Release Date: 20 Jul 96

        This is the "one year anniversary" version of Sentry. It
        contains as many new features and functions as I could cram into
        it. Unfortunately, I didn't get *everything* I wanted to in this
        release, but I did get a lot done (some of which I hadn't
        planned on). Development will continue, so keep your eye out for
        V5.1 and so on...

        ** Please Note: Sentry's Home Page has moved!
        The new location is:

        http://dragon.acadiau.ca/~mike/NightShade/Sentry.html

        Please update any bookmarks and links as appropriate.

        Changes made in V5.0:

          * A new option has been added: Modify Shell commands. With
            this option, SuperUsers can edit or remove commands from the
            DOS command interpreter. For example, you may want to
            disable the COPY command, and rename DEL to ZAP just to keep
            users from causing damage on your system.

          * Protected files can now be upgraded. If a protected file was
            created with an older version of Sentry, you can now bring
            it up to date! Simply re-protect it from the SuperUser menu,
            and Sentry will do the work!

          * The SuperUser menu has been redesigned to allow easier use.
            On the main menu, there are now the User Maintenance, Log
            File Maintenance and System Maintenance Menus. Details on
            each menu can be found in the manual.

          * It is now possible to jump between sub-menus with the press
            of a key. Pressing 'U' brings up the User Maintenance Menu,
            'L' brings up the Log File Maintenance Menu, and 'S' brings
            up the System Maintenance Menu. These hotkeys can be pressed
            from the main menu or from any sub-menu. To avoid conflicts,
            these hotkeys are upper case only.

          * A new initialization setting has been added. This new
            setting, called Last Login Pause, allows the SuperUser to
            define how long Sentry pauses while displaying the last
            login info before clearing the screen. The default setting
            has no pause, and does not clear the screen.

          * The program SDEL.EXE is now included with Sentry. SDEL
            deletes files in the same secure manner that Sentry uses
            when deleting files. Files deleted with SDEL cannot be
            recovered, so be sure of your actions!

          * Users can now reply to messages from the SuperUser.

          * If a user accidently hits return at the login prompt without
            entering a login, they are re-prompted instead of being
            asked for a password.

          * SuperUsers can now select which items to check during a
            security audit.

          * Shareware versions of Sentry can no longer upgrade files
            protected with registered versions of Sentry. This fixes a
            security loophole where a user could download a shareware
            version of Sentry and wipe out all of the registered
            versions' settings on a protected file by upgrading it (if
            applicable).

          * Some minor typos have been fixed.

          * Secure deletion can now be turned on and off via the
            initialization settings.

          * Changes to the initialization settings now take effect
            immediately. You no longer have to exit and re-start Sentry
            to see your changes!

          * View highlighing enables SuperUsers to see "trouble spots"
            easily and quickly. When viewing the user list, it
            highlights expired accounts, expired passwords, locked out
            accounts and more.


        Sentry V5.1
        -----------
        Release Date: Never Released

          * Bug when updating from 4.7 to 5.0 fixed.

          * New registration system allows for more flexibility.

          * Renegade users cannot use the shareware install program to
            attempt to overwrite registered versions.


        Sentry V5.2
        -----------
        Release Date: 10 Sep 96

          * CTRL-C, CTRL-BREAK and CTRL-ALT-DEL can now all be disabled
            in DOS. A new initialization setting allows the user to turn
            this function on and off. When enabled, this feature
            prevents users from breaking out during boot-up, even after
            Sentry has run. Also, Windows and Windows 95 users will
            notice that CTRL-C has also been disabled in the DOS box.

          * Users can now be deleted from or added to the userlist by
            simply pressing the DEL or INS keys. This function works any
            time the userlist is on-screen.

        Sentry V5.4
        -----------
        Release Date: 01 Nov 96

          * A "fast" and a "secure" option have been added to the secure
            deletion initizliation setting. The "secure" setting
            over-writes all data with random numbers during deletion,
            whereas the "fast" option overwrites with 00's.

          * The superuser can now disallow password changes by setting
            the password key to '*' on the initizliation settings menu.
            This may be useful when passwords are pre-defined to force
            "secure" passwords for all users, as opposed to easily
            breakable ones that some users may choose.


        Sentry V5.5

        Release Date: Never Released

          * Internal changes only.


        Sentry V5.6
        -----------
        Release Date: 22 Nov 96

          * Sentry can now protect Windows based programs running under
            Windows 95! Simply protect them in the same manner as
            regular DOS programs, and when Sentry asks, designate them
            as Windows based programs!


        Sentry V5.7
        -----------
        Release Date: 12 Feb 97

          * Anti-Virus versions of Sentry are now available. Please see
            the order form for details.

          * The "Disable CTRL-C" memory problem has been corrected. (Was
            overusing conventional memory when CTRL-C was disabled through
            Sentry).

          * Stricter checking on the "Modify Shell Commands" option.

          * Log file messages are clearer in several places.

          * When protecting files, Superusers are now presented with a
            "menu" of available files, instead of having to enter a
            path/filename.

            echo for each keypress when typing passwords. This makes it
            difficult to determine the length of a password by shoulder
            surfing.
