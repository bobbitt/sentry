        QUICKSTART INSTRUCTIONS
        =======================

        1. If you are upgrading, run your current copy of Sentry and
        select "Export Initialization Settings" from the SuperUser menu.
        Otherwise, skip to step 2.

        2. Unzip SENTRYXX.ZIP into a temporary directory. Overwrite any
        existing files.

        3. Copy ALL original Sentry files onto a floppy disk, and tuck
        it away. This is for emergency recovery if required.

        4. Run the program called INSTALL.EXE. Enter the path you want
        to install Sentry to. This will automatically create all the
        proper initialization settings. If you have not previously
        entered your registration information, of if you are installing
        from scratch, you will have enter it now (registered versions
        only). If you exported the settings in step 1, you will be asked
        if you wish to use them. If you use the exported settings, you
        can skip steps 6, 7 and 8 - your system will already be set up.

        5. Run Sentry. If an error occurs, you should check the
        Readme.txt file for further help.

        6. Log in as "Sentry" with password "Sentry" (note the
        capitalizations). You must log in as a SuperUser, and to do
        this, hold down the CTRL key while pressing ENTER after typing
        the login.

        7. Create the users on your system. The first one you should
        create is you. Give yourself SuperUser access, and delete the
        old Sentry account (a real security violation if you leave it!)

        8. Set up all accounts as you see fit: assign max logins, expiry
        dates and password expiry dates to reflect your needs.

        9. Read the Readme.txt file! This will give you a much more
        in-depth discussion of what to do if problems arise, and how to
        properly secure your system. I know it's long, but if you're
        serious about security, it is time well spent.
